  A [monorepo](http://sonarsource.com/resources/library/monorepo/) management tool on top <br/>of native [Bun
  workspaces](https://bun.sh/docs/install/workspaces)
</h2>

<div className="home-list-container">
  <ul className="home-list">
    <li>Works right away, with no boilerplate required 🍔🍴</li>
    <li>Get metadata about your monorepo 🤖</li>
    <li>Run `package.json` scripts across workspaces 📋</li>
    <li>Run inline [Bun Shell](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/shell) scripts in workspaces ⌨️</li>
  </ul>
</div>


This tool lets you decide the complexity of how you use it. 
To get started, all you need is a normal project using [Bun's native workspaces](https://bun.sh/docs/install/workspaces) feature for nested JavaScript/TypeScript packages.

Think of this as a power suit you can snap onto native workspaces, rather than another monorepo framework.

Start running some [CLI commands](/cli) right away in your repo, or take full advantage of the [scripting API](/api) and its features.

<h2 className="whats-new-title">What's New</h2>

<h2 className="whats-new-subtitle">Notable recent updates 📦</h2>
<div className="whats-new-list">
- More advanced [workspace patterns](/concepts/workspace-patterns) can be used to select workspaces, such as by path.
- It's now possible to include or reference a project's [root workspace](/concepts/root-workspace).
- Configuration updates: Added new [project root configuration](/config/root) to set defaults, and JSONC is supported for configuration files.
- The [Bun Shell](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/shell) is now used by default to run [inline scripts](/concepts/inline-scripts), with the [option](/concepts/inline-scripts#shell) to use the system shell.
- Increased support for Windows users.

## Quick Start

See the [CLI Quick Start](/cli) and [API Quick Start](/api) for starting examples. See the [Glossary](/concepts/glossary) for more fundamental concepts.

## Installation

<RequiredBunVersion className="home-bun-version bun-version" />


You can install the package in your project or simply use `bunx bun-workspaces` to immediately use the latest version of the [CLI](/cli). Installation is required to use the [API](/api).

<SyntaxHighlighter language="bash">
{`# Install to use the API and/or lock your CLI version for your project
bun add --dev bun-workspaces

# Start using the CLI with or without the installation step
bunx bun-workspaces --help`}

</SyntaxHighlighter>

If you use the CLI frequently, you might consider using a shell alias.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="bash">
  {`# Add this to .bashrc, .zshrc, or similar 
# to make it available by default in your shell
alias bw="bunx bun-workspaces"`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Examples in these docs will use the alias `bw` for `bunx bun-workspaces` for brevity.

Note that you need to run `bun install` in your project for `bun-workspaces` to find your project's workspaces. This is because it reads `bun.lock`. This also means that if you update your workspaces, such as changing their name, you must run `bun install` for the change to reflect.
